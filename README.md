### Professional Summary

Senior data strategist and research infrastructure expert with 15+ years' experience spanning statistical computing, open science, and enterprise analytics. I design **reproducible, testable, and reusable data systems** and build **data visualisations that tell meaningful stories**. My approach always accounts for the **organisational change** required to sustain automation. Whether championing FAIR principles or replacing tangled spreadsheets with semantic models and observability, I focus on creating **long-term value — not hype**. Seeking roles that view **data architecture as strategic**, not a solo act of heroism.

### Approach to Data Leadership

> I believe data architecture is inherently **collaborative, strategic, and cultural**. The best pipelines are meaningless without shared understanding, version control, testing, and documentation. I thrive in teams that view **infrastructure as a long-term investment**, not a last-minute fix.
