### Professional Summary
Data architecture and research infrastructure expert with 15+ years of experience spanning statistical computing, open science, and enterprise analytics. I specialise in designing **reproducible, testable, and reusable data systems and data visualisation that tells meaningful stories** â€” as well as navigating the organisational change needed to support automation. Whether advocating for FAIR principles or replacing tangled spreadsheet ecosystems with semantic models and observability, I focus on building **long-term value, not hype**. Iâ€™m seeking roles that recognise data architecture as strategy, not a solo heroic act.
