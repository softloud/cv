### Professional Summary

Senior data strategist and research infrastructure expert with 15+ years' experience spanning statistical computing, open science, and enterprise analytics. I design **reproducible, testable, and reusable data systems** and build **visualisations that communicate clearly and inspire trust**. My approach always accounts for the **organisational change** required to support automation at scale. Whether advocating for FAIR principles or replacing tangled spreadsheets with semantic models and observability, I focus on delivering **long-term value — not hype**. I'm seeking roles that recognise **data architecture as strategy**, not as a solo heroic effort.

### Approach to Data Leadership

> I believe data architecture is inherently **collaborative, strategic, and cultural**. Pipelines are only as valuable as the understanding, testing, and documentation behind them. I thrive in teams that treat **infrastructure as a long-term investment**, not a last-minute patch.
